This folder is as of now created for testing purposes, to map out our path or have it compared to actual coordinates and fix gps output
with regression and averaging.

1) All the data used, as well as all the data is saved in the "data" folder.
2) You can use the raw_data_to_csv.py script to turn a raw gps log into a .csv file with it's data, change it's input each time you
use it to get the data you want.
3) Use map.py to map out said csv data, if you want a cubic spline to connect the points, uncomment the two scripts.
