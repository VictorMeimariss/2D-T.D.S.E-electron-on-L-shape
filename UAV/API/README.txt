Folders are independent of main API code 

API-->

****1)Don't use as soon as you pull the folder from GitHub because One-Drive doesn't give permission for programs to run, instead download and move to directory out of One-Drive.**** 
****2)Models should be configured such that their results for fire is label: Fire for this to work
****3)Before this works you need to change file directories from within ai_models to match your models

1)Use open cmd within the folder and type"pip install -r requirements_falcon.txt".
2)To open server type "python API.py"
3)With cURL you can POST to the API:

*For GPS data in the format of latitude: 40.7128,longitude: -74.0060
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/gps -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"latitude": 40.7128,"longitude": -74.0060}'

*For images from a directory
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/detection -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"image_directory\": \"C:/Users/victo/Downloads/fire.jpg\"}"

In this particular example, if you copy a file as a path "C:\Users\victo\Downloads\fire.jpg" this is what you get, you need to escape the 
double quotes, and make the "\" into backslashes "/" otherwise the cURL command won't work.
