                                                 Signal Loss strategy
1) When gps loses signal -> Use IMU and odometry as well as estimations as to where the plane actually is (maybe a weighted average of the 2)
2) Estimations will be based on the last reading, speed and direction of the aircraft (Extrapolation), obviously errors will occur, if the
plane suddenly changes those two variables.
3) If we already have the data recorded by the gps, we interpolate by deleting missing blocks or unnatural points and entering our
interpolation function which estimates where the plane was.

                                    Getting signals and processing them in real time
1)Ardupilot has automatic processing so the upper strategy is not needed, however the module's output format needs to be the same as the
input in Ardupilot. ✔
2)On a latter date we will be able to see the plane's coordinates (ardupilot output) from the mission planner app, for debugging purposes
we will be sending the module's parsed output to the API
3)GPS will need to run on boot.
4)All previous gps readings need to be displayed with timestamps. "displayed in the API, Ardupilot will just have the parsed coords as input"
5)Whenever GPS loses its signal the last known location needs to be displayed.✔

Things to consider***: Ardupilot already retains and processes last known output so changing the input will probably result in Ardupilot
mistaking the last known output as a valid GPS input without triggering its failsafe mode, therefore a "No Fix" json message will be
sent to Ardupilot, the API will be getting the timestamp of the last known location.
