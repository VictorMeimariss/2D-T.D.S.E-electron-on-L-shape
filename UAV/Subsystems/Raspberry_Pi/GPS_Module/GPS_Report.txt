!!!! DO NOT use GPS_dev scripts as boot is running, serially reading from both will lead to boot file stop reading and sending data to the fc unless you want to debug or test, where boot will have to restart(located in ~/SDVNC/ until sometime later.

Instead to look for the raw coordinates use "minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB1" , and to send commands use "minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2"

1) GPS opens on boot, no need for extra configuration, it might take 1-2 minutes to send valid data to the fc because of the cold start, depending on the occasion, might take longer, 
might take a couple of seconds if the system was working previously.

2) To connect to the flight controller you need to connect from the pi to the fc(TX-->RX3, RX-->TX3, GND-->GND), once connected the flight controller will be detecting signals from the gps.
